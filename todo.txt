This is our todo list. If you want to work on something add your name to the end of the
task after the period. If there is already a name, work on something else. If you
completed it, turn the '-' into a 'x'. Feel free to add more tasks when you discover
them. This is definitely not all of them.

SELENIUM:
- Do stuff with selenium since that is a requirement for the project.

FRONT END:
- Fix broken features in templates. Certain features like the fields not showing
    up in "search_listings.html" need to be fixed.

- Update the header section in "base.html" to better match "homepage.html".
    This will make it so we don't have to write a new header section for every
    page since almost all of them should have the same options.

CHAT:
- Fix bug where if a customer messages a seller for two seperate listings, both
    of the conversations are mixed into one. They should be seperate for each
    listing. - Edgar

- Add some way for customers and sellers to agree on a price, meetup location,
    and meetup time from within messages. I think the best option is a
    "Transaction" model which is tied to a seller, customer, and listing. - Edgar

LISTINGS:
- Implement Transaction. Mauricio

x Implement "my listings". Mauricio

PRODUCTS:
- Implement the rest of the product models. Mauricio
